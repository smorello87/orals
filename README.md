# Welcome to my Orals Prep

This project collects my reading lists, journals, brainstorms, and tentative schedule as I plan and study for my Orals Examination for April/May 2019. Beyond storing bibliographic information that will be useful for me later, it is also a public-facing record that traces my thinking as it develops toward the disseration. 

As of now, my three Orals lists center on the following topics:
* [**Digital Studies and Textualities**](/digital_list.md)
* [**Theories of Perception and the Mind**](/perception_list.md)
* [**Queer Modernisms and Affects**](/queer_modernisms_list.md)

In addition to the above, I also include a file, [**"Daily Dissertation"**](/Daily_Dissertation.md), that logs my developing thoughts as I compile and revise these lists. The entries began in the summer of 2018 and continue to the present day, and are updated, on average, about once a week. Though above lists contain 25-30 works each, a glance at the Daily Dissertation and revision history indicates that they were much larger in scope and content, each containing about 50-60 texts at the outset. As it stands, the Daily Dissertation is most useful for the way it continually poses the questions that drive my reearch, considers the reasoning behind including and removing certain authors and topics, and attempts to define the stakes of my intervention. 

After finalizing the lists in December 2018, I will begin reading the works between January-May 2018, for the exam, (tentatively) scheduled for May 15 2018.
